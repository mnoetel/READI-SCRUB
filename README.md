# READI SCRUB Project
 For SCRUB cleaning code and dashboard
 
 
## Branch information

This branch, `bensmith_y_axis_percentages_with_plotly`, is work in progress to implementing plotly in the percentages graphs, which would allow interactive exploration.

The implementation is quite buggy and the work is not high priority, so this will remain an unfinished branch unless it becomes a higher priority.

## SCRUB Cleaning Code
This file downloads the data from qualtrics, matches it across waves, and cleans the data into labelled numeric data to be exported to the open science framework. If you've noticed any errors in the data or want any changes, please make a pull request.

## SCRUB Dashboard Code
This code generates the SCRUB dashboard available [here](https://noetel.shinyapps.io/covid/).

I'm still grappling with git, and will move the beta version into a branch soon, but in the meantime, it's in a separate file and the beta-dashboard is available for view [here](https://noetel.shinyapps.io/scrub_beta/)

Please feel free to add features then make a pull request and I'll update the public dashbaord, and sorry for the sporadic commenting.
